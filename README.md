This thesis explores the application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) to predict international trade flows. By leveraging the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and a refined adjacency matrix, the study aims to capture both temporal and spatial dimensions of international trade data. The ECI is computed using the SITC product data from 1962 to 2021, while the adjacency matrix considers bilateral distances between major cities weighted by population shares.

Our research evaluates different hyperparameter configurations and optimizers, including AdamW and RMSprop, combined with learning rate schedulers like StepLR and CosineAnnealingLR. We conducted experiments using both regular and exponentially inverted distance matrices to assess their impact on the model’s performance. The findings reveal that the exponentially inverted distance matrix significantly enhances the model’s ability to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, resulting in lower validation loss and improved predictive accuracy.

This thesis contributes to the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) applications in economic forecasting. The integration of temporal and spatial data through innovative matrix formations demonstrates a robust framework for predicting complex trade patterns, offering valuable insights for policymakers and economists in an increasingly interconnected world.
